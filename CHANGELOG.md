### Special Thanks

* @1011x, @jhaye, @lightdark, @maloki, @skrlet13, @melody, @stolas, @hak, @mecaka: those who've
  been helping with governance, offering advice, and/or been working on this for the past few
  months.
* @woozle: who helped us host both the Wiki and Mattermost.
* Everyone who's been cheerleading us the past year, and helped us have the courage to Fork Off
  from Mastodon, and understanding of that we're working on a different premise than Mastodon did.
  That's kind of why you all joined us in the first place.
